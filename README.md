# Neural-Hybrid-System-Modeling (NSHM)
Matlab Toolbox for Distributed Neural Hybrid System Modeling 

This toolbox implements data-driven process including: PCA featuring; ME bisecting; Merging, in modeling complex dynamical systems, particularly with a focus on increasing the scalability of the learning models.

# Related tools and software
This toolbox makes use of the Neural Network Verification (NNV) for reachability analysis; GNU Linear Programming Kit (glpkmex) and YALMIP in training the neural networks.

# Installation

1) Install MATLAB

2) Clone or download the nnv toolbox from (https://github.com/Yangyejiang/Neural-Hybrid-System-Modeling)

3) Open matlab, then add directory to root directory where NSHM exists on your machine

# Running tests and examples

Go into the Neural-Hybrid-System-Modeling/examples` folders to execute the scripts for testing/analyzing examples.
